# Functional Programming


In section we pull together some of the main themes of the course so far:

- modelling data with sum and product types; and
- sequencing computations with `map`, `flatMap`, and `fold`.

By looking briefly at the theoretical underpinning of structural recursion we will see a deep relationship between these concepts. We'll then gain some more experience implementing our own classes with higher-order functions.
