## Conclusions

In this section we've explored *classes*. We have seen that classes allow us to abstract over objects. That is, to define objects that share properties in common and have a common type.

We also looked at *companion objects*, which are used in Scala to define auxillary constructors and other utility methods that don't belong on a class.

Finally, we introduced *case classes*, which greatly reduce boilerplate code and allow *pattern-matching*, a new way of interacting with objects, in addition to method calls.
