## Thanks #{-}

Many thanks to Richard Dallway and Jonathan Ferguson,
who took on the herculean task of proof reading our early drafts
and helped develop the rendering pipeline that produces the finished book.

Thanks also to Danielle Ashley, who updated all of the code samples
to use [Tut][link-tut] and increased our code quality 100% overnight!

Thanks also to
Amir Aryanpour,
Konstantine Gadyrka,
Rebecca Grenier,
Joe Halliwell,
Jon Pearce,
Jason Scott,
N. Sriram,
Daniel Watford,
and Audrey Welsh
who sent us corrections and suggestions
while the book was in early access.
Knowing that our work was being used
made the long haul of writing worthwhile.
