## Conclusion

We have had a very brief introduction to the fundamentals of Scala:

* expressions, which evaluate to values; and
* declarations, which gives names to values.

We've seen how we can write literals for many objects, and use method calls and compound expressions to create new objects from existing ones.

We have also declared our own objects, and constructed methods and fields.

Next we're going to see how a new kind of declaration, a class, provides a template for creating objects. Classes allow us to reuse code and unify similar objects with a common type.
